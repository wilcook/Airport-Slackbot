# Airport-Slackbot
A slackbot to notify incoming flights for the JFK airport

In its current state, the Slackbot does respond as expected to users on Slack when addressed as @nobanusa-flightbot. 

The app relies on the Flight XML API, which is not free. Although this could still be workable solution, it creates a need for charity which may or may not be an option depending on the situation. In order to make this as flexible a tool as possible, assistance from other developers in resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated.
